Uses multiple AI models to fact check information, give it an innacuracy score, and give insight as to why it got that inaccuracy score. This extension also supports text-to-speech with the insights.

The API key is the wrong one on .env (since it always gets expired when found in a public project), but you can email me (pierrevertej@gmail.com) and I will provice it for you. You just need to replace it on the .env file and everything should work properly.
